        <p>
            Loyal, curious, and famously amusing, this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it's the Affenpinscher's apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.

            <p>
                A medium-sized flushing and retrieving dog known for its rich brown coat, the Boykin Spaniel is avid, eager, merry, and trainable. This mellow housedog and tenacious bird dog was once South Carolina's best-kept secret. Boykins are medium-sized spaniels, larger and rangier than Cockers but more compact than Springers.

        <p>he Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a lively, friendly, affectionate dog with his family but can be somewhat of a one-person dog. With his strong protective nature and well-developed pack instincts, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier gets along well with children (when raised with them), cats, and other dogs. </p>
        <h2>
            <li>Irish Wolfhound</li>

        <p>
            The calm, dignified, and kindly Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all AKC breeds. Once fearless big-game hunters capable of dispatching a wolf in single combat, Wolfhounds today are the most serene and agreeable of companions.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <li>Pug</li>

            <p>
                Once the mischievous companion of Chinese emperors, and later the mascot of Holland's royal House of Orange, the small but solid Pug is today adored by his millions of fans around the world. Pugs live to love and to be loved in return.

            <p>
                The Saint Bernard does not rank very high in AKC registrations, but the genial giant of the Swiss Alps is nonetheless among the world's most famous and beloved breeds. Saints are famously watchful and patient 'nanny dogs' for children.
            </p>

            <li>Borzoi</li>

            <p>
                Among the most impressively beautiful of all dogs, the aristocratic Borzoi is cherished for his calm, agreeable temperament. In full stride, he is a princely package of strength, grace, and glamour flying by at 35 to 40 miles per hour. Borzoi are large, elegant sighthounds.
